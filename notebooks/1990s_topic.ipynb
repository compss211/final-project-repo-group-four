          "To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever  Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture  So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential \"Yo! MTV Raps\" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation  While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered  100. \"All of the Lights\" - Kanye West 99. \"No Lie\" - 2 Chainz feat.

          "To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever  Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture  So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential \"Yo! MTV Raps\" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation  While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history.

          "To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever  Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture  So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential \"Yo! MTV Raps\" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation  While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered  100. \"All of the Lights\" - Kanye West 99. \"No Lie\" - 2 Chainz feat.

Let me know Cuz if you really like me I suggest you tell me so Got no time for silly games, that ain't even why I came Cuz I may be the kind of guy you like  Please understand the way I feel I must have trust or there's no deal My emotion's ain't to be Played with or given free I appreciate greatly The way you toleratered me Sometimes I do act flaky I wouldn't blame you if you hate me You put up with my butt When I wouldn't give it up Yeah, I know that really sucks But if you wait awhile, I'll make it up  CHORUS  Who me?  A tease?  Brother, please You're just having bad memories About some skeeze who did the squeeze And had you on your hands and knees Look, I am telling you straight out That's not what I'm all about I'd just be playing myself out If I spent the night at your house Now don't get me wrong I didn't mean to turn you on We haven't known each other long But this is my life not just a song  CHORUS",

Outta nowhere comes the woman I'm dating Investigation maybe she was demonstrating But nevertheless I was pleased My day was going great and my soul was at ease Until a group of brothers started bugging out Drinking the 40 oz, going the nigga route Disrespecting my black queen Holding their crotches and being obscene At first I ignored them cause see I know their type They got drunk and got guns and they wanna fight And they see a young couple having a time that's good And their egos wanna test a brother's manhood So they came to test Speech cause of my hair-do And the loud bright colors that I wear  I was a target cause I'm a fashion misfit And the outfit that I'm wearing brothers dissing it Well I stay calm and pray the niggas leave me be But they're squeezing parts of my date's anatomy Why, Lord, do brothers have to drill me ? Cause if I start to hit this man he'll have to kill me   I am everyday people (2x)   I told the niggas please let us pass, friend I said please cause I don't like killing Africans But he wouldn't stop and I ain't Ice Cube But I had to take the brother out for being rude And like I said before I was mad by then It took three or four cops to pull me off of him But that's the story y'all of a black man Acting like a nigga and get stomped by an African    The moral of the story is you better look very hard at who you're stepping to, cause you might get killed or shot and it's not worth it. Africans need to be loving each other and unite",

Yeah   Our lifestyles be close-captioned, addicted to fatal attractions Pictures of actions be played back in the midst of mashin' No fairy tales for this young black male Some see me stranded in this land of hell, jail, and crack sales Hustlers hardly think of culture Or the repercussions while bustin' on backstabbin' vultures Sellin' my soul for material wishes, fast cars, and bitches Wishin' I live my life a legend, immortalized in pictures Why shed tears?

Look back on childhood memories, and I'm still feelin' the pain Turnin' circles in my 9th grade, dealin' cocaine Too many hassles in my local life, survivin' the strain And a man without a focus, life could drive him insane Stuck inside a ghetto fantasy hopin' it change But when I focus on reality we broke and in chains Had a dream of livin' wealthy and makin' it big Over football chose to cook raw, wouldn't take but I did And after all my momma's thankin' God for blessin' the child All my momma gots to do now is collect it and smile; smile!

Strange whispers, cowards conversate, so quick to diss us Takin' pictures for the feds in desperate hopes they'd get us Hit us off, give us plenty centuries Forgive my sins, since I entered many penitentiaries The best revenge is \"Fuck friends!\" – we military minded soldiers Bustin' shots blindly, tryin' to find Jehovah To help me, somebody save me, lost and crazy Scared to drop a seed hopin' I ain't cursed my babies Maybe now niggas feel me now, picture my pain Embrace my words, make the world change And still I smile, nigga   And now a moment of silence, let us pray And as you journey into outerspace May the angels help to lead the way May the prayers that our families made Shine up on your soul to keep you safe And all the homies that done passed away They there to greet you as you pass the gates And as you headed to the tunnel's light I hope it leads to eternal life We say the prayers for our homie 'Pac   Smile, smile for me All you need to do is smile Woooo smile for me Come on, smile for me",
